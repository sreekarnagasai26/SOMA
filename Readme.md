Abstraction of Complexity:

Simplifies repetitive or complex tasks (e.g., routing, state management, or DOM updates) by providing reusable components and predefined structures.
Lifecycle Management:

Handles initialization, updates, and destruction of components (e.g., React's component lifecycle, Vue's hooks).
Modular Structure:

Enables developers to build applications using smaller, reusable modules that fit into a larger architecture (like components or services).
Event Handling and Binding:

Manages user interactions (e.g., click events) and binds them to functions, reducing the need for manual event listeners.
State Management:

Provides tools or patterns to track and react to state changes (like Vuex or Redux), ensuring smooth data flow.
Dependency Injection:

Allows for automatic injection of services or dependencies where needed, promoting modularity and ease of testing.
Routing and Navigation:

Manages application routes and navigation between pages or components with minimal effort (e.g., React Router).
Performance Optimizations:

Handles rendering efficiently, ensuring that only necessary updates are applied (e.g., virtual DOM in React).
Built-in Utilities and APIs:

Offers helper functions (e.g., for HTTP requests, validation) to speed up development without third-party libraries.
Development Tools:

Provides hot reloading, debugging tools, or CLI utilities to boost productivity during development.
